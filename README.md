Text-Sentiment-Analysis-using-IMDB-dataset

# Description

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using the IMDB Reviews dataset. The goal is to classify text reviews as positive or negative, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The final outcome is a Python script that preprocesses input text, predicts sentiment, and provides evaluation metrics.

# Steps

**1. Text Preprocessing**

Preprocessing is a crucial step to clean and normalize the text data. The following operations are performed:

1- Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words (tokens).

2-Stopword Removal: Removing commonly used words that do not contribute to the sentiment, such as "the," "is," etc.

3-Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form for normalization (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

**2. Feature Engineering**

The preprocessed text data is converted into a numerical format for machine learning using:

1-TF-IDF Vectorization: A statistical measure to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus.

2-Word Embeddings (Optional): Advanced feature representation using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText (if applicable).

**3. Model Training**

A classifier is trained to predict sentiment:

1-Algorithms Used:

2-Logistic Regression

3-Naive Bayes (Multinomial)

Training Process:

1-The dataset is split into training and testing subsets.

2-The classifier is trained on the training set and tuned for optimal performance.

**4. Model evaluation**
we use the Confusion Matrix it Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
